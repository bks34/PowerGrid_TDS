A simple program for Power system time-domain simulation.

The cases used in this program comes from Matpower and Psat, but I just used the topology of this cases. The specific data is randomly generated, because I don't have enough knowledge about Power Grid to generate data I need from these files.
If you are an electricity-related major, you can add related code in this progrma.
